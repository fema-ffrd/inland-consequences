# Inland Consequences

Inland consequence modeling is essential for actuarial assessments, scenario evaluations, and Benefit-Cost Analyses (BCAs). Accurate Annualized Average Loss (AAL) data helps set insurance premiums, manage financial risks, plan for emergencies, and justify investments in flood mitigation. FEMA requires rapid and reliable AAL data to improve flood damage assessments. This project is intended to develop a flexible framework that meets FEMA's needs, leveraging existing methodologies to provide trusted AAL data for both coastal and inland areas.
