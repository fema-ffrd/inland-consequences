# Consequence Solution

**Consequence modeling** is essential for **actuarial assessments, scenario evaluations, and Benefit-Cost Analyses (BCAs)**.\
Accurate **Annualized Average Loss (AAL)** data supports setting insurance premiums, managing financial risks, planning for emergencies, and justifying investments in flood mitigation.\
FEMA requires rapid and reliable AAL estimates to improve flood damage assessments.

The **Consequence Solution** is designed to deliver a flexible and transparent framework that meets FEMA’s needs by leveraging established methodologies to produce trusted AAL data for both **coastal** and **inland** areas.
